📌 Todo List App (React + Vite)

This is a simple yet powerful Todo List App built using React and Vite. It allows users to:

✏️ Add new tasks with Timing&Date (prevents adding empty tasks or duplicate tasks with the same name)

✅ Mark tasks as completed

🗑️ Delete individual tasks

♻️ Remove all tasks with a single click



This project helps in understanding React Hooks, component-based structure, and state management in real-world scenarios.
